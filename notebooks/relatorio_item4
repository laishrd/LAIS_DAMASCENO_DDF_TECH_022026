          "From the brand Lightweight Cardigan Previous page Best choice Black cardigan for women Most Wished Navy cardigan women Wardrobe Essentials Grey cardigan women New Color You will like--- Next page Product Description NOTE Lightweight and skin friendly fabric, a little thinner than a t-shirt, so that does cause it to wrinkle. When you receive it you can wash it in cold and hung on a hanger to dry and the wrinkles will decrease. Just the right thickness for Summer evenings or Spring/Fall.The light color, like white, may be a little see through. Note: Do remind to check the size chart before ordering. This cardigan is in normal size, if you are more like a loose sense, then ordered up a size and the sleeve is slim fit! Tip: Color may vary slightly from image. Colors may vary from different viewing devices.. For the color of the product, please refer to the actual received. DESIGN&OCCASION Great for jeans, leggings, or little dresses,completes an out fit for a wedding! Perfect sweater for just about any event - I bought it for a chamber music performance, and also wear it to teach and for church. It is very comfortable, soft, and flattering! I bought 2 colors Gray and brown . They are fantastic the material very soft and very light excellent for office . I wear all the time at work. The fitting was so perfect . I highly recommend this product to my co workers and to all woman who loves to wear light blazer! I ordered this to go over a sleeveless dress. I love it! The cut is flattering, not boxy. I\u2019m 5\u2019 4\u201d and weigh about 185. I ordered an XL and it fits great. The length covers my bubble butt. Sleeves are 3/4 length and easily push up and STAY! Not tight on upper arms. It is made of cotton and spandex, not sheer so it covers what needs to be covered without being bulky. Highly recommended! HIGH QUANLITY MATERIAL Does this wrinkle easily? Is this hard to iron? The material is super soft,does not wrinkle and washes great!! If you dry on low, take out of dryer quickly and hang u, it does not need ironing. It doesn't wrinkle easily. Once it fell off the chair I had it on and was on the floor overnight, and it only wrinkled a bit. I lightly steamed it, and it was fine. When I took it out of the package, it smelled bad. Always wash before putting on clothes. After washing, there will be no smell and no wrinkles. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this little cardi!!! The material is soft, its really good quality, not thin, not thick, 3/4 sleeves looks just like the picture the seller posted & it\u2019s perfect, it lays nicely & I absolutely love it I wish they had it in every color ! For reference, I am 5\u20193\u201d & I weigh 134lbs, I purchased a small & it\u2019s fits me perfectly! Great for jeans, leggings, or little dresses, I\u2019m sooooo happy I bought this. I do not put most of my clothes from Amazon in the dryer, esp if I\u2019m unsure of quality, so idk if it would shrink, I wash everything on normal then hang to dry & my clothes, I lightly sprayed this cardi with some water in a spray bottle after hanging to dry & it looked like I ironed it. About Size: Depending on her type of body on the top, I'm 5'2, small torso, 36C (it doesn't matter because it is open). I think the small will fit. It is beautiful I think it runs true to size.
